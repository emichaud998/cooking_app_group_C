# Meet the Team!


## Emily Michaud

Hi, my name is Emily and I am currently a senior majoring in computer science! As a senior in her last semester, I am excited to build one final project that will encompass all of the computer science knowledge I have gained and am still learning over the past 4 years at college. I am excited to create an application that is built using the microservices architecture, as I believe this architectural style is very beneficial for creating maintainable and scalable web systems. I have a lot of knowledge using the Javascript/Typescript programming language, working with SQL databases, creating Express REST APIs, creating Javascript/HTML UIs. I have a decent amount of knowledge using applications like Docker as well. I am currently a Healthcare Software Engineer working with MITRE, where I have gained a lot of experience coding on both the backend and frontend side. From this job I have also gained a lot of experience working collaboratly on a team with a large codebase, which is actually organized in a similar architectural style to the microservices architecture. I hope to learn a variety of applications and skills that can help in creating high performance applications for a large number of users, as I believe this is essential when creating successful applications for the modern web.

## Duy Pham

I'm a junior majoring in computer science, and I'm fascinated by web technologies, especially things related to system architecture. By doing this project, I hope to learn essential skills for creating performance and optimized applications that could serve thousands of users. I could contribute to the team on the backend side with my working experience as an SE intern.

## Andrew Leger

I'm a senior majoring in Computer Science, and will be graduating at the end of this semester. Most of my computer science courses of choice have related to web programming, database design, and networks in general, so that's 3/4 people in the group who like working on backend stuff. I'm familiar with Javascript, am quickly gaining familiarity with typescript like my groupmembers, and know how to do things like express servers, postgres databases (as well as a bit of mongo and mapReduce), and bootstrap. Much of which was learned in cs326 and cs445 (great classes). Languages I'm confident working in: C, C++, Python, JS and to a lesser extent Typescript, and of course SQL.

## Thanh Phan

Hi, I am Thanh Phan and I am a junior majoring in computer science. I am from Vietnam which is exactly 12 hours ahead of Umass. I am mostly a backend guy but I have some frontend experience also. I have a lot of experience working in the backend such as: SQL database, APIs, organising the codebase... For frontend, I am mostly familiar with basic html/css and Bootstrap but I am willing to learn React/Angular if needed. I am fascinated by this course since my dream job would be a software architect in the future.
