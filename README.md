# Cooking Recipe App- Easily Find Recipes You'll Love!

Our project idea is to create a cooking recipe application using microservices that can help users find and share recipes in a fast and easy way. We want to create an application that allows multiple users to find recipes that they can make based on their dietary preferences or available ingredients, and that also allows users to share their own recipes for other users to enjoy. We want to create a beautiful UI that allows users to browse a large collection of recipes in an organized way, and that also allows users to search for specific recipes or filter recipes by dietary choices or available ingredients. We also would like to allow users to leave ratings and reviews for each recipe so that other users can see the average ratings of recipes or see what people have said about each recipe. We hope to see this application attract a large number of users, and so we want to create this application in a way that can be easily scaled to support a larger user base. We also hope to see users submit a lot of their own recipes to the application in order to grow our available list of recipe stores.
